# EduLearn - Project Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Directory Path Issues**
- Fixed incorrect paths in `routing_entry.php` to match the actual `core /` directory (with space)
- Updated all file includes to use correct relative paths

### 2. **Database Model Issues**
- Added missing `initializeDatabase()` methods to all models:
  - `User::initializeDatabase()`
  - `SalesModel::initializeDatabase()`
  - `NewsModel::initializeDatabase()`
- Fixed incorrect database connection paths in `BaseModel.php`

### 3. **Controller Issues**
- Fixed method names in `AuthController.php` to match routes:
  - `showLogin()` and `processLogin()`
  - `showRegister()` and `processRegister()`
- Fixed incorrect file paths in controller includes
- Removed references to non-existent models (`Lesson`, `Assignment`)

### 4. **View Issues**
- Added `rinder` security constant check to all view files
- Fixed CSS path in `header.php` to work with XAMPP structure
- Corrected view file includes in controllers

### 5. **Security Improvements**
- Added `define('rinder', true)` to `routing_entry.php`
- Added security checks to all view files: `if (!defined('rinder')) { die('Direct access not permitted'); }`

### 6. **Database Setup**
- Created proper database table creation SQL in initialization methods
- Added automatic database initialization on each request
